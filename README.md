# ShrinkIt Archive Library for Swift

This project is a direct off-shoot fork of the AppleCommander project and implements a pure Swift API to manipulate ShrinkIt (NuFX) 
archives ([Apple File Type Note $E0/8002](http://www.apple2online.com/web_documents/ft_e0.8002_shrinkit.pdf)).
If you looking for NuFX Fileformat see also at [NuLib.com](https://nulib.com/library/FTN.e08002.htm).
